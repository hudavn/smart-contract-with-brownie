# SMART CONTRACT WITH BROWNIE
This is my first smart contract practicing with Brownie. 

Some code are forked from https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/simple_storage/blob/main/SimpleStorage.sol

Something I have achieved after finishing this:
- Learn how to deploy SC easier by using Brownie
- Test contract 
- Deploy to a testnet through third-party like Infuria
- Make private key more secure by using *accounts* module of Brownie
- Using .env and brownie-config.yaml in basic
